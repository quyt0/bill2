## About this webpage

This is a website whose title says it all. However, just for reference and caution purposes only

The author will not be responsible for any actions with bad intentions (if any) such as fraud, forgery, etc. by you.

## How I made this?
With [Html5-QRCode](https://github.com/mebjas/html5-qrcode) for scanning QR codes

Some codes at [here](https://stackask.com/question/dich-nguoc-data-qrcode-vn-ve-thong-tin-ngan-hang) (only Vietnamese) to decode the texts read from QR into transfering informations.

By using HTML for creating a canvas, some inputs, buttons to retrive informations from users (name, bank name, account number)

And by using JavaScript + embedding neccessary fonts for adding texts, numbers into canvas.
